â€¦And should we thus submit our life to religion, or should we interpret religion
 so that it serves our lives instead? There are as many schools as there are 
 philosophers, as many stories as there are human beings (and let us not forget 
 elven beings, nor dwarven, halfling, gnomish ones, nor any other such sapient 
 creature familiar with the quandaries of the soul). I, for my part, having 
 survived now more than one hundred and twenty years (vodka and radishes work 
 wonders, lend no creedence[sic] to anyone who claims differently), can swear 
 with all certainty that there is no way to reconcile everyone at once, and what 
 pleases one will provoke whingeing and sulking in another, and will undoubtedly 
 cause a third to reach for his knife if it dares depart from his known, narrow 
 world by so much as a hair. What then are we to do? How should we live? Why, as 
 we like, as our soul urges, disregarding all the brayings of philosophers and 
 ethicists, those contained in this tome included - disregard them as we would 
 fairy tales or old wives' legends.
